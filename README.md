# Create an accessible site for a photographers platform


# Project description

This project is part of OpenClassrooms "D√©veloppeur d'application - JavaScript React" training.

The goal of this project is to complete and improve an existing site in order to be accessible for disabled people. The initial project is [here](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Front-End-Fisheye.git). Only the first page was already coded.
Figma file was also provided [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Q3yNeD7WTK9QHDldg9vaRl/UI-Design-FishEye-FR?node-id=0%3A1).

Main missions:

- The content of the photographer page will be dynamically generated based on the photographer.
- When the user clicks on the "Like" icon, the number of likes displayed is incremented. The total number of likes of a photographer must correspond to the sum of the likes of each of his media.
- Media can be sorted.
- The arrow keys on the keyboard are also used to navigate between media in the lightbox.
- Display the content of the three contact modal fields in the console logs.
- All photos must have text descriptions.
- The user must be able to use keyboard commands to navigate the site.
- Use "semantic" HTML elements as much as possible.
- The code must pass AChecker tests with no ‚Äúknown issue‚Äù (so that it is WCAG compliant).
- All event handling (e.g. clicks and key presses) must be configured.
- Use a free screen reader.
